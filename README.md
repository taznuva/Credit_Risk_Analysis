# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis to build and test different machine learning models to evaluate credit card risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, using different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes is needed. In this analysis, imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries are used to build and evaluate models using resampling.
